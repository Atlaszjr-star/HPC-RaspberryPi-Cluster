## Introduction
Parallel and distributed computing is an interesting topic, but building a High Performance Computing(HPC) supercomputer/cluster has often required the usage of expensive hardware and complex machine setups. Thanks to the Raspberry Pi's low costs, small physical size and powerful performance, It's easier and cheaper for users to explore the parallel computing even with industry standard and learn both software and hardware technologies. The main goal of this project is to build a 8-node distributed computing cluster system using the Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computers for some simple simulations. 
## Background info
* Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi OS
* Parallel Computing - MPI
* OSMnx
* NetworkX

## Hardware Components

* 8 Raspberry Pi 4B computer single-boards, 4GB RAM, one of them is used as master node in cluster.
* 8 microSD cards as the hard disk of Raspberry Pi.
* 8 sets of cooling cubes for cooling the RAM and processor.
* 2 sets of case shelf and cooling fans.
* 1 Gigabit Switch for message communication between the nodes in the local network.
* 1 Powerstation with 10 ports.
* 8 Gigabit Ethernet cables.
* 8 USB-C power cables.
