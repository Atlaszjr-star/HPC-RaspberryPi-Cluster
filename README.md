## Introduction
Parallel and distributed computing is an interesting topic, but building a High Performance Computing(HPC) supercomputer/cluster has often required the usage of expensive hardware and complex machine setups. Thanks to the Raspberry Pi's low costs, small physical size and powerful performance, It's easier and cheaper for users to explore the parallel computing even with industry standard and learn both software and hardware technologies. The main of this project is to build a 8-node distributed computing cluster system using the Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computers for some simple simulations.
